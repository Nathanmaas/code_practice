#Auto guess

We previously created a guessing game app that picked a random number and had you guess what it was until you got it correct.

Now we want to make the game guess it self. Add code to make guesses about what the number is automatically.

The goal is to make it guess the number as quickly as possible (without cheating).

You can use your version of the guessing game as a starting point or the one included in this folder.
